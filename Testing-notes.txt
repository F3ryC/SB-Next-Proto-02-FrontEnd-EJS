Context:  Brainstorming for future improvement of Sproutbeat.com.  I have been thinking about the next iteration/version of Sproutebeat.com.  I have an exsitting API that I may be able to re-use.  I would like to have a new Mobile App (eventually for iOS, Android, but with single code-base) where I can let users browse, find, and play all of the games from Sprooutbeat.  I would like for that experience to be the same as web.  This is something like "Sproutbeat 2..0" idea 

Task: Help me with a starter app that helps me to get started with the above idea




Step 0: Run the test-auth.js to get the auth token 

Test the Profile Endpoint:
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer dvf0fnQfeEPVbI28GPF5bQ4XjVn2" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/auth/profile

Test User Registration:
curl -v -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dvf0fnQfeEPVbI28GPF5bQ4XjVn2" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"displayName":"Test User"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register


Create Content:
curl -v -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dvf0fnQfeEPVbI28GPF5bQ4XjVn2" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Content",
    "description": "Test Description",
    "category": "movie",
    "contentType": "video",
    "tags": ["test", "sample"]
  }' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/content

Get All Content:
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer dvf0fnQfeEPVbI28GPF5bQ4XjVn2" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/content

Get Single Content (replace CONTENT_ID with an actual ID from the previous response):
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer dvf0fnQfeEPVbI28GPF5bQ4XjVn2" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/content/CONTENT_ID

Update Content:
curl -v -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dvf0fnQfeEPVbI28GPF5bQ4XjVn2" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Updated Content",
    "description": "Updated Description"
  }' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/content/CONTENT_ID


  Delete Content:
  curl -v -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dvf0fnQfeEPVbI28GPF5bQ4XjVn2" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/content/CONTENT_ID



Tips:
Always include the -v flag in curl commands to see detailed request/response information

Use json_pp to format JSON responses
curl ... | json_pp

Save the token in a variable for easier use:
TOKEN=$(node test-auth.js | grep "^TOKEN=" | cut -d'=' -f2)
# Then use it in commands
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" ...
